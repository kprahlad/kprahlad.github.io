<p>Hello! I’m K. Prahlad Narasimhan. I’m from Chennai, Tamil Nadu and am pursuing a PhD in the Applied Mathematics and Statistics Department at <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu" target="_blank">SUNY, Stony Brook</a>. Before moving to New York in Fall 2022, I completed an Integrated MSc in Mathematics  at <a href="https://www.niser.ac.in" target="_blank">NISER, Bhubaneswar</a>. I enjoy doing problems in theoretical computer science. To keep myself  sane, I run long-ish distances, trek longer distances, and take pictures of things. Head over to the <a href="/academics.html">Academics</a> section to take a look at mathematics thinly veiled as computer science and to the <a href="/tag/personal">Personal</a> section for anything but. My twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/pranarkas" target="_blank">@pranarkas</a> and my email address is <a href="mailto: prahladnarasim.kasthurirangan@stonybrook.edu" target="_blank">prahladnarasim.kasthurirangan@stonybrook.edu</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Topics I am currently working on:</strong> Computational Geometry, Graph Theory, Parameterized Complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Newest addition to the Academics section:</strong> <a href="/2022/11/20/Dominator-Coloring-Parameterized-by-Cluster-Vertex-Deletion-Number/">Dominator Coloring Parameterized by Cluster Vertex Deletion Number</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Newest addition to the Personal section:</strong> <a href="/2022/11/26/Hikes-in-Finland/">Hikes in Finland</a>.</p>
