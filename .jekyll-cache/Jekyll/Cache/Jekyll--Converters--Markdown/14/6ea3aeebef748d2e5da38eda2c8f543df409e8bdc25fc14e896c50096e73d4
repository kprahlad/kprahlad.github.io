<p>Growing up, I played a bunch of sports: cricket, football, and volleyball to some success; table tennis, basketball, and chess for the fun of it. I caught the running bug in late 2019 (after my <a href="/2020/08/01/Sandakphu-A-Prologue/">disastrous trekking experience</a>) and have been trying to keep it going through the pandemic. I am not very good at it, but boy do I enjoy a run. My short-term running goal is to get back to half-marathon shape but I do hope to run a marathon in the future!</p>

<p>Apart from sports, I enjoy hiking (2020 was a <em>terrible</em> time to pick up this hobby), portrait photography, and classical (Carnatic) music - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o55TExI7Dbc" target="_blank">here</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/iQTs7PSnX3k" target="_blank">are</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqvDbr4snIQ" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqsOCgWskDY" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5hSMSpb1Qs" target="_blank">my</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZksCuzV59E" target="_blank">favourite</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go-mAJpH6_w" target="_blank">songs</a>. I sketch and read books irregularly (I really should do more of them).</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve listed my posts on running, trekking, and other miscellaneous stuff below. Click on the title to head to the blog post on the topic and the <i class="fas fa-caret-square-down"></i> icon to read its excerpt.</p>

<p>I hope to maintain a collection of my race reports and training blocks here:</p>

                After a 6-month hiatus due to COVID, I finally started running again in September, 2020. It took me 6 months of <i>very</i> slow progress (including a 2 week pause while <a href="https://kprahlad.github.io/2020/12/11/Returning-to-NISER/">quarantining in NISER</a>) to build up to a mileage of around 25 KM a week. I decided to use <a href="https://freerunningplans.com/5k-running-plans">this</a> 8-week beginner 5 KM plan to cap this running season.  I ended up running the distance in 27:10 on the 17<sup>th</sup> of April - not as good as by PB (26:46) from 18 months back, but much better than I expected. Here's my race report.

<p>I want to document my treks and hikes here:</p>

                This is short read about my first attempt to trek to Sandakphu. This is meant to be read after my first post about my <a href="https://kprahlad.github.io/2020/04/03/Sandakphu/">second attempt</a>. My first trek after a break of a couple of years lasted a mere three days and ended in one of the most harrowing days of my life.

                This is the account of my second attempt to trek to Sandakphu - a summit in the Eastern Himalayas. Let us just say that my first attempt...<a href="https://kprahlad.github.io/2020/08/01/Sandakphu-A-Prologue/"> did not go well</a>. This week long trek had me digging deep into my mental reserves while rewarding me with not just great satisfaction but some photographs that I am very proud of!

                Since I am one of the first people to be back in campus, I thought it would be helpful to pen down my experience so far with the hope that it will help you get a bit more clarity on what to expect and pack smartly. Also because I have little else to do.
