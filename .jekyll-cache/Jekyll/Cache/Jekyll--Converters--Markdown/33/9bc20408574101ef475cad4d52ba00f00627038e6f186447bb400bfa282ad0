<p>Hello! Iâ€™m K. Prahlad Narasimhan. Iâ€™m from Chennai, Tamil Nadu and am  doing my Integrated M.Sc. in the School of Mathematical Sciences at <a href="https://www.niser.ac.in" target="_blank">NISER, Bhubaneswar</a>. I enjoy doing problems in theoretical computer science. To keep myself  sane, I run long-ish distances, trek longer distances, and take pictures of things. Head over to the <a href="/academics.html">Academics</a> section to take a look at mathematics thinly veiled as computer science and to the <a href="/tag/personal">Personal</a> section for anything but. My twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/pranarkas" target="_blank">@pranarkas</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Topics I am currently working on:</strong> Computational Geometry, Graph Theory, Parameterized Complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Newest addition to the Academics section:</strong> <a href="/2021/02/12/Guarding-Terrains-and-Covering-Chordal-Graphs/">Guarding Terrains and Covering Chordal Graphs</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Newest addition to the Personal section:</strong> <a href="/2021/04/20/Race-Report/">Race Report - Return to Running</a>.</p>
