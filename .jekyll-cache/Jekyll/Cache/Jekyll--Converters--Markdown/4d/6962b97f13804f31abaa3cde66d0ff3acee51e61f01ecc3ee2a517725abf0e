<h2 id="an-academic-history">An Academic History</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm currently enrolled in a 5-year Int. MSc.  course at NISER, Bhubaneswar and am majoring in mathematics with a minor in computer science. My study here is supported by the Department of  Science and Technology through the INSPIRE SHE fellowship. My research  interests lie in the realm of theoretical computer science -  specifically, I‚Äôm working on problems in computational geometry, graph  theory, and parameterized complexity. I‚Äôve previously worked on automata theory, cryptographic applications of cellular automata, and optimization. I presented my  first publication titled <em>‚ÄúOne-Sided Discrete Terrain Guarding and Chordal Graphs‚Äù</em> at CALDAM 2021.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="/documents/CV_Prahlad.pdf" download="">PDF¬†of¬†my CV</a> (updated: January 14, 2022).</p>

<p>Here is a list of my publications:</p>

<ul>
    
        <li><a href="/2021/02/12/Guarding-Terrains-and-Covering-Chordal-Graphs/">Guarding Terrains and Covering Chordal Graphs</a>: The <i>Discrete Terrain Guarding</i> problem (discussed in one of my <a href="https://kprahlad.github.io/2020/05/11/Terrain-Guarding/">previous posts</a>) has been shown to be NP-Hard, but it remains to be seen if it is FPT with respect to the size of the solution size. In this direction, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3186897">Ashok <i>et al.</i></a> proved in 2015 that <i>Orthogonal Discrete Terrain Guarding</i> is FPT. They used a lemma proved by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comgeo.2007.02.002">Katz and Roisman</a> which established a relationship between this problem and the <i>Clique Cover</i> problem in chordal graphs. My (first!) paper extends this lemma and takes a step forward in understanding the fixed-parameterized tractability of <i>Discrete Terrain Guarding</i>.</li>
