<p>Two of the most prolific problems in graph theory are <em>Dominating Set</em> and <em>Graph Coloring</em>. Consider a simple graph \(G\) and a natural number \(\ell\). We say that vertex \(v\) <em>dominates</em> a vertex \(u\) if \(v = u\) or \(u\) is a neighbor of \(v\). In the Dominating Set problem, we are required to report if there exists a set of vertices \(S\) of size at most \(\ell\) such that for every vertex \(v \in V(G)\), there exists a \(s \in S\) such that \(s\) dominates \(v\). In <em>Graph Coloring</em>, we must decide if it is possible to color the vertices of \(G\) with at most \(\ell\) colors such that no two neighboring vertices get the same color. Such a coloring of the vertices is referred to as a <em>proper coloring</em>.</p>

<p><em>Dominator Coloring</em> combines these two problems. Once again, we are given a simple graph \(G\) and a natural number \(\ell\). We are required to decide if there exists a proper coloring of \(G\) such that for every vertex \(v\), there exists a color class \(c\) where every vertex that is colored \(c\) is dominated by \(v\). In this paper, <a href="http://www.niser.ac.in/~aritra/">Prof Aritra Banik</a>, <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/~vraman/">Prof Venkatesh Raman</a>, and I study the parameterized complexity of Dominator Coloring.</p>

<p>The problem, which was <a href="https://faculty.nps.edu/rgera/papers/WestPoint_Dom_coloring_final_submitted_changed.pdf">first described</a> in 2006 and studied in several papers since then, still hosts several important open questions. While it is known, due to <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Algorithmic-Aspects-of-Dominator-Colorings-in-Arumugam-Chandrasekar/649cbb0f199da4318456d775a36d2e3942c423f7">this work</a> by Arumugam <em>et al.</em>, that the problem is FPT (Fixed-Parameter Tractable) when parameterized by \((t,\ell)\) where \(\ell\) is the number of colors used and \(t\) the <em>treewidth</em> of \(G\), the structural parameterized landscape of the problem remains unexplored. We initiate the study of Dominator Coloring through the lens of structural parameterization.</p>

<p>Our first result in this paper is a randomized \(O^*(c^k)\) algorithm for the problem where \(c\) is some constant and \(k\) is the size of a graphâ€™s Clique Modulator, a set of vertices whose deletion results in a clique. This algorithm is obtained by a non-trivial adaptation of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/20M1323369">the recent work</a> by Gutin <em>et al.</em> for List Coloring parameterized by the clique modulator that uses an inclusion-exclusion based polynomial sieving technique, and in addition uses a dynamic programming based exact algorithm we develop for Dominator Coloring.</p>

<p>Later, we go on to prove the main result of the paper that Dominator Coloring is FPT when parameterized by the size of a graphâ€™s Cluster Vertex Deletion (CVD) Set, in contrast to the \(W[i]\) hardness result for List Coloring parameterized by the CVD set size. En route, we design a simpler and faster deterministic FPT algorithm when the problem is parameterized by the size of a graphâ€™s Twin Cover. We believe that this algorithmâ€™s approach, which uses a relationship between Dominator Coloring and List Coloring that we establish, is of independent interest.</p>
