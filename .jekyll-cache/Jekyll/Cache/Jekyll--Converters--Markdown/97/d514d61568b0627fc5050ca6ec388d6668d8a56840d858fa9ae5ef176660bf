I"e<p>I was working with <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in/~spsuresh/">Dr. S.P Suresh</a> at CMI on introductory automata theory during the summer of 2018 when I first came across Kleene Algebras. I had not done any abstract algebra then and this topic was way too abstract for me to make much sense of it. After completing a course on Group Theory the following semester, I went back to this topic and proved most of the results that were left as exercises in the book I was following - <em>“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-1844-9_10">Automata and Computability</a>”</em> by D.C Kozen. While I was working on this, I discovered that the axioms that were used to define a Kleene Algebra were not independent - I was able to derive one of the axioms that involved the Kleene star operator from the others. I later found out that Kozen was the first one to axiomatize Kleene Algebras in his <a href="https://doi.org/10.1006/inco.1994.1037">1996 paper</a> in which he mentions “No attempt has been made to reduce the axioms above to a minimal set and no claim is made as to their independence”. I have, however, not done any further literature survey to see if my result is already known. It seems too trivial to not have been discovered already, to be honest.</p>

<p>The small manuscript linked below has the proof of my claim. If you find any typos, mistakes or just  want to talk about this topic, <a href="mailto:kprahlad.narasimhan@niser.ac.in">email me</a>!</p>
