I")<p>You are the lead cartographer for Blobland, a country which has a lot of states. For the sake of aesthetics, you hope to color the states that share a border with different colours. How many colours do you need? An obvious solution is to colour all the different states with different colours, but that would require a lot of colours. Can you do better? It is easy to see that there exists a map that requires four colours. Are there maps that need more than that?</p>

<p>This question, first posed by Francis Guthrie, a British cartographer in 1852, puzzled some of the most famous mathematicians in the late-19<sup>th</sup> and early-20<sup>th</sup> centuries. It was finally answered in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken in a two-part monstrosity of a paper that contained 700 pages of hand calculations and thousands of cases solved by a computer program. This (in)famous “proof” divided mathematicians of the time into two groups - those who did not believe that the cases solved by the cases where error-free and those who did not believe that the cases solved by hand were error-free.</p>

<p>The proof got the attention of the philosophical community as well. In particular, they were concerned with the following question: what is a proof? If a set of statements are not surveyable (which Appel’s and Haken’s result was surely not), can it really be considered a proof?</p>

<p>At the <a href="https://cnchou.github.io/mini-course/" target="_blank">Mini-Course on Computation</a> organized by Chi-Ning at Harvard GSAS, I delivered a talk on January 12, 2022 to a general audience on this topic. In this talk, I addressed the history of the problem, some key components of the eventual proof, and its philosophical implications. Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkf2LFJMRew" target="_blank">recording</a> of the talk and here are its <a href="/documents/4-Color Theorem.pdf">slides</a>.
