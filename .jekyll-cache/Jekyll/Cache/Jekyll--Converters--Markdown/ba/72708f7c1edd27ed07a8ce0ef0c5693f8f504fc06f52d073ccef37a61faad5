<p>Growing up, I played a bunch of sports: cricket, football, and volleyball to some success; table tennis, basketball, and chess for the fun of it. I caught the running bug in late 2019 (after my <a href="/2020/08/01/Sandakphu-A-Prologue/">disastrous trekking experience</a>) and have been trying to keep it going through the pandemic. I am not very good at it, but boy do I enjoy a run. My short-term running goal is to get back to half-marathon shape but I do hope to run a marathon in the future!</p>

<p>Apart from sports, I enjoy hiking (2020 was a <em>terrible</em> time to pick up this hobby), portrait photography, and classical (Carnatic) music - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o55TExI7Dbc" target="_blank">here</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/iQTs7PSnX3k" target="_blank">are</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqvDbr4snIQ" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqsOCgWskDY" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5hSMSpb1Qs" target="_blank">my</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZksCuzV59E" target="_blank">favourite</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go-mAJpH6_w" target="_blank">songs</a>. I sketch and read books irregularly (I really should do more of them).</p>
