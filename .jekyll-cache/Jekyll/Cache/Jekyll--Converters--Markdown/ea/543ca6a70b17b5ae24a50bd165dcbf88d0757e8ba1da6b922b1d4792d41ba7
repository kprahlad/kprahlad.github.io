<h2 id="an-academic-history">An Academic History</h2>

<p>I’m currently enrolled in a 5-year Int. MSc.  course at NISER, Bhubaneswar and am majoring in mathematics with a minor in computer science. My study here is supported by the Department of  Science and Technology through the INSPIRE SHE fellowship. My research  interests lie in the realm of theoretical computer science -  specifically, I’m working on problems in computational geometry, graph  theory, and parameterized complexity. I’ve previously worked on automata theory, cryptographic applications of cellular automata, and optimization. I presented my  first publication titled <em>“One-Sided Discrete Terrain Guarding and Chordal Graphs”</em> at CALDAM 2021.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="/documents/CV_Prahlad.pdf" download="">PDF of my CV</a> (updated: January 14, 2022).</p>

<p>Here is a list of my publications:</p>

                The <i>Discrete Terrain Guarding</i> problem (discussed in one of my <a href="https://kprahlad.github.io/2020/05/11/Terrain-Guarding/">previous posts</a>) has been shown to be NP-Hard, but it remains to be seen if it is FPT with respect to the size of the solution size. In this direction, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3186897">Ashok <i>et al.</i></a> proved in 2015 that <i>Orthogonal Discrete Terrain Guarding</i> is FPT. They used a lemma proved by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comgeo.2007.02.002">Katz and Roisman</a> which established a relationship between this problem and the <i>Clique Cover</i> problem in chordal graphs. My (first!) paper extends this lemma and takes a step forward in understanding the fixed-parameterized tractability of <i>Discrete Terrain Guarding</i>.

<p>Here is a list of reports that I have submitted as part of my coursework or at the end of an internship:</p>

                Optimization has a very simple premise - you want to maximize or minimize something with respect to a bunch of constraints. In <i>Linear Programming</i>, we further restrict our study to the case where the constraints are also linear and the condition imposed on each of these functions is that they must be  at most a fixed value. In <i>Semidefinite Programming</i>, we impose another restriction - the matrix described by the variables must be positive (that is, it must be both positive semidefinite and self-adjoint or, equivalently, it must be a matrix whose eigenvalues are positive reals). For my 7<sup>th</sup> semester math project, I wrote a report that discusses these two optimiization constructs. The report assumes literacy in basic algorithms, linear algebra and (a tiny bit of) probability.

                As part of my course on Functional Analysis in my 7<sup>th</sup> semester, I was required to present a topic that was an extension of the course. I chose to read up on annihilators of Banach spaces and characterize the conditions required for the sum of two closed subspaces of a Banach space to be closed. You know, just because.

                The <i>Terrain Guarding</i> problem is a variation of the <i>Art Gallery</i> problem - you are given a polygonal chain and are required to find the minimum number of vertices on it to guard a given set of points on the chain. It turns out that this is a hard computational problem. During my quest to understand <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3186897">this paper</a> by Ashok <i>et al.</i>, I picked up a few more concepts and decided to write a report which seeks to let anyone who has done a basic course in  algorithms understand (almost) current research in this topic. This eventually let to my <a href="https://kprahlad.github.io/2021/02/12/Guarding-Terrains-and-Covering-Chordal-Graphs/">first publication</a>.

When I came back to it a semester later, I discovered that the number of axioms required to define this algebra can be reduced by one.

                <p>One of my friends was applying to Google for a job and got this problem  in one of the final written rounds. This was a fun little problem that  helped me procrastinate…</p>

                I came across a couple of fun problems when I was going through <i>"<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-11080-6">Linear Algebra Done Right</a>"</i> by Axler. I really enjoyed this book and it was great for a "second reading" of the basics of Linear Algebra.
