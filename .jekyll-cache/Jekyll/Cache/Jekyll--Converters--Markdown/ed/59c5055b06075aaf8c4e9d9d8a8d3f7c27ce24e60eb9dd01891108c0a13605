I"W<p>As part of my course on Functional Analysis in my 7<sup>th</sup> semester, I was required to present a topic that was an extension of the course. I chose to read up on annihilators  of Banach spaces and characterize the conditions required for the sum of two closed subspaces of a Banach space to be closed. You know, just because.</p>

<p>The report assumes a basic understanding of Banach spaces and the knowledge of various versions of the <em>Hahn-Banach</em>  theorem. It also uses a small fact from convex optimization theory.  Iâ€™ve done my best to iron out typos and avoid mistakes. If you find any typos, mistakes or just  want to talk about this topic, <a href="mailto:kprahlad.narasimhan@niser.ac.in">email me</a>!</p>
