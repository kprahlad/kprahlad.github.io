![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/DSC_0191.jpg)*Somewhere in the Eastern Himalayas. March, 2020.*

Hello! I'm K. Prahlad Narasimhan. I'm from Chennai, Tamil Nadu and am  doing my Integrated MSc. in the School of Mathematical Sciences at [NISER, Bhubaneswar](https://www.niser.ac.in). I enjoy doing problems in theoretical computer science. To keep myself  sane, I run long-ish distances, trek longer distances, and take pictures of things. Head over to the [Academics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/academics.md %}) section to take a look at mathematics thinly veiled as computer science and to the [Personal]({{ site.baseurl }}/tag/personal) section for anything but.

**Topics I am currently working on:** Computational Geometry, Graph Theory, Parameterized Complexity.

**The most recent book I read:** [Veerappan: Chasing the Brigand](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34314211-veerappan). An account of the life of a notorious bandit as told by his captor.
