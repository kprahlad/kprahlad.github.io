excerpt: This is the account of my second attempt to trek to Sandakphu - a summit in the Eastern Himalayas. Let us just say that my first attempt...<a href="https://kprahlad.github.io/2020/08/01/Sandakphu-A-Prologue/"> did not go well</a>. This week long trek had me digging deep into my mental reserves while rewarding me with not just great satisfaction but some photographs that I am very proud of!

The week leading up to the first of March, 2020, was eventful. For one, I had a horrible schedule for my Mid-Semester exams which had me writing 3 core exams in 36 hours. However, it was the messages that I was getting on my phone from the "Sandakphu - 1st March" group on WhatsApp that  made the week memorable. The trek coordinator sent us a couple of videos from the previous batch of the unexpected snowfall in the region. He  also warned us that the 7-day trek might be cut down by a day since two  of the campsites - Sabagram and Gorkhey were inaccessible thanks to the  weather. I remember being supremely excited for one moment and  questioning myself the next when I saw these messages.

It was in October 2019 that I first attempted to trek to Sandakphu. It is a story in itself (read the prologue [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-08-01-Sandakphu-A-Prologue %}) after you finish this), but here is the TL; DR: the attempt was rudely  cut short by my lungs giving up on me at the second camp - Kalipokhri. I was hit by Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) - hard and was forced to  descend to basecamp without getting to the summit. I was crushed. I had  been looking forward to trekking in the Himalayas for a few years and to that particular trip for about 3 months. At Jaubhari - the base camp, I called up my mom to tell her about what had happened and told her that  I'm going to have to come back here to finish the trek. I went back to  my university and decided that I would strengthen my lungs. So that's  what I did - I trained for a half marathon for 14 weeks and ran it in  January (Another story that I should write about. It'll happen.  Hopefully). I registered myself for the trek in March within 3 weeks of  being sent back by the mountains.

 So, why was I questioning  myself when I saw those messages, you ask? I was scared. Scared that the four and a half months of being the healthiest I've ever been will be  inadequate. The mental images of not being able to complete the trek  this time around were not pretty. It was with this nervous energy that I boarded my flight to Kolkata on the 29th of February. I had planned to  spend the night at the airport dorm and take an early morning flight to  Bagdogra. Since the dorm was full, I had to sleep on a  not-very-comfortable sofa in the waiting area of the airport.  Surprisingly, I got some decent sleep in, and soon enough I was on  SpiceJet's Q400 flying to Bagdogra (Side Note: They air ads on the  SpiceJet flights. I find that super weird for some reason).

## Back to Jaubhari

I had proposed to meet with my trek mates - Mala, Priya, and Sireesh,  who had landed the day before, for breakfast. Since I had an hour to  kill, I went in search of some good chai and then returned to the  airport gate to find the small dhaba that they were eating in. We  finished our (rather hearty) breakfast and met with few others from our  group who had just landed. After a generic round of introductions, we  were off to Jaubhari. We stopped a couple of times during our 4-hour  drive - first at a small fruit shop in Mirik and then near a tea estate  for lunch.

About 10 minutes from Jaubhari is a hamlet named Manebhanjan which is  the main hub for those who trek (or take a jeep) to Sandakphu. As we  drove past this village, I smiled at the monastery next to which I  stayed the night I returned from Kalipokhri in October. I had walked up  the steps of the monastery the following morning to sneak a look at  Kanchenjunga before I had to leave for Siliguri. As seems to be the  custom with IndiaHikes, the company that I was trekking with, we were  greeted with chai at our base camp. After yet another round of  introductions, Tanmay, our trek leader for the following week,  introduced himself and briefed us about the trek and the Green Trails  initiative. [Green Trails](https://indiahikes.com/green-trails-waste-management-indiahikes/) is an ongoing project which is an integral part of IndiaHikes. It seeks to leave the mountains as a better place for the next trekker. All of us  were given an Eco-Bag, a bag we could tie around our waists and could  put the trash we found on the trail in. At the end of each day, we would segregate the waste into three - biodegradable, non-biodegradable and  landfill. These three sacks would be taken back to base camp from where  the company would dispose of the waste at the end of the season.   

When I looked around my "team", as Tanmay called it, I was convinced that I  would not remember anyone's name. I was wrong. The team had 20 people in total. A family of five based off Mumbai - Manan, Nikita, Dhvani, Umang and Roshan (I spent very little time with them, unfortunately); The  "Tidke Sisters" - Namrata and Himani; Sireesh, from Hyderabad; A father-daughter duo - Indra and Varsha; Pradnya and Timsi - who were  friends from work; Lt. Samarth of the Indian Navy posted in Vizag; Mala, from the UK; Nitin, a fellow Chennaite; Yogin, from Mumbai; James, from Colorado, who had come to India as part of an NGO project; Priya, from  Mumbai; Amalesh, from Guwahati; and Yours Truly.

We had about an hour to explore the basecamp after which we had to get our dinner. To calm my nerves, I headed down to a small football field near our homestay, meditated and then headed back to camp. While Tanmay was handing out my health card - which was used by the organisation to monitor a trekker's SpO2  percentage and signs of AMS - I told him about my previous trek. He  dismissed it immediately and told me to enjoy the food and take Diamox - a medicine that helps you acclimatise faster by making you pee more -  as a precaution. I was confused by his nonchalance but decided to eat  the worry away anyway. I volunteered to be the "alarm guy" to wake the  team at 6:00 am the following morning. After thirty minutes of repacking my bag, I hit the bed and slept like a log. 

## The Trek to Tumling

I woke everyone up and failed to get sunrise shots the next morning. A  bunch of us went to explore the village before our breakfast at seven.  We were introduced to our guides - Nima da and Kumar da an hour later  and after a couple of group photos, we were off to our destination for  the day - Tumling. The trek to our first rest point, Lamaydhura, was a  steep ascent through a pine forest. We saw few Rhododendrons - for which this trek is famous for - just starting to bloom and Daphnes on our  way. After a short stop for tea, we continued on our way for an hour and a half to Meghma where we had our lunch. Our impromptu singing session was cut  short by cloudy skies and we hurried to get to Tumling before the  weather turned ugly. I remember very little of the trek this day. I had  found the first day of trekking exhausting in October and was determined this time around to prove to myself that I was up to the challenge. In  retrospect, it looks like I was more focused on getting to the next camp than enjoying my way up there.

Within fifteen minutes of making it into our tea house at Tumling, what  started as a gentle drizzle outside quickly transformed into hail. We  could not hear ourselves from across our room and were glad to be tucked into our blankets with hot soup for company. We had a celebratory  dinner since it was Indra's birthday and headed back to our rooms to  take our oximeter readings. I was relaxed since I was feeling great and  the day of trekking had been easy for me. The machine disagreed. A  reading around 85% was barely passable at the altitude we were at. 72%  flashed on its tiny screen. Then 73%, then 74%. Over the course of a  very long minute, it went up to 82% and stayed there. Tanmay asked me to take a whole tablet of Diamox and went about his way. I was rummaging  through my medicine bag when James asked me if everything was alright. I smiled and told him that my readings were not looking good. "Again" was left unsaid but was loud and clear to everyone listening. I told him  how surreal the situation was and how it felt like I was reliving the  evening from five months back. The others joined in on the conversation  and tried to cheer me up. My head was muddled and I just shrugged my  shoulders and went under the cover of my blankets. I told myself to  enjoy the trek the next day since it could well be the last day of  trekking I did in a while. I was worried I would not be able to sleep,  but apparently my body did not care about my head's turmoil. So sleep, I did.

## The D-Day: Trek to Kalipokhri

I woke up early the next morning hoping to catch the first rays of the  sun hitting the Sleeping Buddha. Sireesh and James accompanied me to a  nearby stupa from where we had a better view of the mountains. The hail  had completely transformed the village and we saw patches of snow  dotting the landscape as we walked up the steps to the stupa. We also  had the hail to thank for the brilliantly clear skies.  However, a solitary rogue cloud spoilt the classic "Sunrise Photo" as it stood firmly between us and the peak of Kanchenjunga. We returned to  our tea house, had breakfast, packed our bags and set off to  Kalipokhri. The trek to Kalipokhri from Tumling is through the  Singalila National Park and has two distinct sections: The first half is a descent to Gairibas while the second is an ascent to Kalipokhri. We  stopped at the entry point of the National Park briefly to get our  trekking permits after which we were on our way to Gairibas.

Nitin, as most who have lived in Chennai all  their lives will be, was giddy when we started walking on snow  immediately after entering the gates of the Park. *"Aayiron! Rendaayiron! Muuayiron!..."* he proclaimed to his selfie camera as he counted his three steps on the  snow - each at a hefty price of a thousand rupees. A few of us stopped  at a particularly pretty spot for photos while the others continued  onward. Nitin's antics and the great weather kept me in great spirits  till Kaiyakatta - our lunch point. When we joined with the rest of the  team, Tanmay told us that we were way behind schedule and that the  weather was not looking good for the afternoon. Since the trail was a  fairly steep descent to Gairibas, Samarth and I decided to "run" down  the rest of the way to the village (though it felt like running, looking back at our speeds, it is what one would consider a breezy walk at sea  level). We all downed some momos and chai and continued on our way to  Kaiyakatta. By the time we reached Kaiyakatta, the weather had turned  for the worse and we had to fish out our rain-gear.

We had to spend some extra time at our lunch point since the owner had  underestimated how much food we would need. The spicy chowmein she  scrambled together was worth the wait, however. With less than an hour  to go to get to camp, fog set in and with it my spirits took a nosedive  for some inexplicable reason. My head was hell-bent on convincing me  that exerting myself to a place where I would have to be ferried down -  again, was a useless endeavour. I tried to keep it occupied by counting  the number of steps I took and told myself that I could have a small  break after every hundred steps. Horrible idea. I was struggling to take twenty continuous steps. I trudged on, feeling sorry for myself when  the black lake - Kalipokhri, came into view. I walked into our camp and  asked Tanmay to take my oximeter reading. I wanted to get it out of the  way - one way or the other. 86%. I swore and got a stern few words from  Tanmay to watch my tongue. After a few congratulations from my  trek-mates, who were as interested in my readings as I was, I breathed a sigh of relief. We had our evening chai and returned to huddle  together while Tanmay shared his tips on travelling on a budget. Soon  afterward, dinner was served and all of us hit the bed after what had  been a long, tiring day of trekking. 

## The Trek to Sandakphu

I sneaked up early the next morning to see the sun rise over the lake. A fairly fluffy dog accompanied me from the village to the lake. The lake looked quite underwhelming without the fog that covered it the previous afternoon. It was much smaller than I expected it to be and I didn't  get any of the shots that I had in mind. Much to the disappointment of  the dog, who wanted to go further down somewhere, I trekked back to the  village since we had to leave early to Sandakphu. The trek to Sandakphu  from Kalipokhri is relatively short but the ascent is steep. We left our camp at 7:30 am after breakfast with the plan to get to Sandakphu  before noon. The ascent was demanding since most of it was over slushy  snow. I had to put my camera inside my rucksack halfway through the day  thanks to the constant drizzle that we had to trek with.

After a particularly steep hill, the trail joined with the road which  had a marker claiming that Sandakphu was 0 km away. Lies. Our  destination was just shy of a kilometer away which included close to a  hundred feet of vertical gain. We forced our legs up the final hillock  and made our way through a tiny arch that welcomed us to the highest  point in West Bengal. I sat down on a stone marker right beside the arch waiting for a sense of accomplishment or pride to hit me. Neither did.  My stomach rumbled and demanded food and I laughed at the anticlimax.  Tanmay congratulated all of us as we had chai and biscuits at Sandakphu  for making it to the top. Our camp for the day was Aahl, twenty minutes  from Sandakphu. After our regular oximeter readings (Mine climbed up  from 75% to 85% slowly just to keep me on my toes), we had our lunch.  Kumar da got some of the embers that they used for cooking to keep us  warm. A few of us stayed at the dining room to de-freeze our feet until  it was time for our daily huddle. 

Tanmay proposed we play  Mafia, but all of us wanted to hear some trekking stories. Tanmay began  with a hair raising story about how he had rescued a trekker with HAPE - a deadly condition where fluid starts collecting in the lungs due to  high altitude, when he was leading a team to Goechala in 2016. The folks at IndiaHikes have [written about it better than I ever can.](https://indiahikes.com/how-evacuation-of-hape-victim-changed-an-ordinary-man-into-a-true-trekker/) In need of some humour after what was a harrowing hour of storytelling, we moved onto some lighter stories. Nitin told us all about his previous  trek to Roopkund where he could not reach the summit and was so weak  that he had to be brought down by a mule to the previous camp. Though  his story was scary, his expressions and descriptions of the journey on  the mule had us all in splits. James followed with his own hilarious  story about his neighbour's rabbit. He had moved houses and learnt that  his new neighbour (referred to as Mr. Rabbit henceforth) had a rather  fancy rabbit which he would take to shows and whatnot. One day, he  noticed that his dog was playing in the yard with what seemed to be  roadkill. On closer inspection, he realized that it was Mr. Rabbit's  rabbit. He cleaned up the rabbit, removing the bloodstains and the mud,  sneaked into Mr. Rabbit's house and kept it back in its cage. A few  months later, Mr. Rabbit told him about how someone had dug up his  rabbit's grave and kept it back in its cage. James never let him know  who it was.

After dinner, Tanmay warned us that the temperature  would drop below zero and that it was advisable to use two sleeping bags instead of one. He also confirmed that we would head to Gurdum instead  of Sabagram since the route to the latter was under 4-5 feet of fresh  snow. All of us took it in our stride and showed no disappointment.  Getting into two sleeping bags and a liner was an annoying exercise, but once inside, I was warm and comfortable. I slept soundly. 

## The Trek to Gurdum

James and I woke up early to trek back to  Sandakphu to see the sun rise over the Sleeping Buddha from there. We  lost our way in the middle and decided to wait for Nima da, who was  coming with a few others who had woken up a little later. Due to this  delay, we could not get to Sandakphu before the first rays hit the  mountain range but got a great view while trekking there. From  Sandakphu, we could see the entire Sleeping Buddha as well as Everest  Cluster. Everest's peak, nestled between Lhotse and Makalu and behind  some clouds, remained unseen. After taking a few shots of the mountains  and ourselves, we had our morning tea and headed back to camp.

The trail to Gurdum began from Sandakphu and was a steep descent through a bamboo forest. Since there were no places to stop in between for  lunch, we packed some khichidi for lunch and headed back to Sandakphu.  The fresh snow mixed with the forest mud made for some slippery slush  which produced some spectacular falls. As I found out at the end of the  day, Nitin couldn't help but fall every few minutes and Sireesh,  according to Umang's and Samarth's account, had a fall worthy of The  Looney Tunes. I was at the front of the team with Priya for most of the  first couple of hours of the day's trek. We would jog down the slush,  which counter-intuitively provided us with more balance, and wait for a  while to make sure that we were within earshot of Nima da and continue  onward. Nima da pointed out scratch marks on a tree on the trail and  told us that those were an itchy bear's doing. We stayed a little closer to him after that.

We stopped for lunch at a clearing and  waited for everyone else to join. After an hour, we continued on our way to Gurdum. The trail went through thicker bamboo forests and was barely visible under the fallen bamboo shoots and leaves. I ended up trekking  with Namrata for a while and she asked me if I was proud of completing  the trek this time around. I remarked that I was more relieved than I  was proud and let the conversation move on. As the terrain became  steeper again, I peeled off from the front of the group and had the  trail to myself for the next hour. This gave me time to muse over  Namrata's question and my answer to it. Looking back, the off-hand  answer I gave seems to be the best one I have. 

I slowed down  significantly after a junction where I had to stop for 10-15 minutes to  wait for Nima da since I wanted to soak in the last few hours in the  mountains. I trekked with Varsha the rest of the way to camp since she  seemed to have some trouble with her knees. She told me about how she  was involved in a motorcycle accident a couple of years back and had an  undiagnosed issue with one of her legs. Though she was struggling, she  refused to take any help and made it down on her own. Once we made it to the Gurdum homestay, I joined Tanmay and Roshan who were playing  cricket with the usual terrace cricket rules as well as the "if it rolls down the side of the mountain you are out and you must bring the ball  back" rule. We ended up losing the ball (Tanmay decided to flaunt his  straight drive) by the time the rest of the team reached. 

After chai, Tanmay moderated a debriefing session where each of us talked  about our experience and what we learnt from this trek. He then told us  about what he thought about each of our personalities and was pretty  spot on. As Mala put it, it really highlighted the amount of effort he  put into his job and how thorough he was. He then handed out each of us a memento - a fridge magnet of the Sleeping Buddha and gave out two  badges - The Spirit of Trekking badge to Indra and Roshan and the Green  Trails Warrior badge to James. Indra, the oldest member of our team, had been one of the first to reach the campsites every day and his fitness  was nothing short of inspirational. Roshan, on the other hand, was the  youngest member of our team and was always ready to help everyone around him. James had consistently collected the most amount of trash each day from the trail. After what was a solemn couple of hours, all hell broke loose after Nitin decided to start impersonating Tanmay. With only a  short easy descent left in the trek, the whole team was relaxed - we  laughed at each other and with each other through dinner till it was  time to hit the bed. It is the most fun I have seen a bunch of adults  have.

## The Trek to Sepi

I overslept but thankfully so had a lot of people and Tanmay was  easygoing with the designated time to leave for Sepi. We left Gurdum at  around half past nine, an hour after we had planned to, after our  breakfast. The trail to Sepi was an easy descent till Sirikhola and a  level walk after that. I decided to keep my camera away and collect as  much trash as I could from the trail. An hour into the trek, we got to  cross a small tributary of the Sirikhola - the river after which the  town is named. I had found my way to the front of the team again so had  the time to descend to the riverbed and meditate there for a while.  After another hour on the trail, we got to Sirikhola. The trail gave way to tarmac and the trash on the path became too much for twenty trekkers to handle. We continued on our way through the town for around half an  hour after which we were greeted with cold Rasna at our final lunch  point at Sepi. After handing over our sleeping bag liners and health  cards, we had our lunch and boarded our cars back to Jaubhari. I ended  up in the car with Manan, Nikita, Dhvani, Umang, and Roshan and finally  got to interact with them. The last thirty minutes of the three-hour  journey was worrying since Nikita and Dhvani were getting carsick and  had their sick-bags out. We managed to get back to Jaubhari without  either of them barfing.

Since almost half our team was leaving  to Siliguri in search of a hot bath and some beer, we said our goodbyes  and promised to keep in touch. The rest of us headed back down to our  homestay. After some chai, I slept for a couple of hours and woke up in  time for dinner. All of us had dinner and headed to one of the rooms to  play Mafia. It took those of us who had not played the game before a lot of time to understand it, but soon enough, Tanmay moderated the first  game. To be fair, I understood very little of the game but somehow my  team won. We began the second game with Nitin as a moderator so that we  could get more of his impersonation of Tanmay. However, the game fell flat and we decided to have a horror story session instead.  Tanmay managed to pull a jump scare on Nitin who fell from his bed  screaming - *"Katharanda!"* which translates to "He's shouting,  dude!" and hid inside a blanket promptly afterward. This fairly normal  Tamil exchange sent everyone laughing to the verge of tears and all  attempts at further conversation were interrupted by fits of laughter -  mostly by Namrata and Himani.

## Back to Civilization

All of us woke up late after the previous night's laughter session. We  were treated to hot aloo paratha for breakfast along with chai. I ate  knowing that it would be one of the last tasty meals I'd have in a while - I was heading back to a place with mess food after all. I'd planned  to run a 5K in Jaubhari and had got my running shoes to keep in the  cloakroom at the homestay. I set out a couple of hours after breakfast  with the plan of running at a very easy pace so that I could enjoy the  fresh mountain air. However, the road to (and thus from) Manebhanjan was much more hilly than I had signed up for and I was completely winded  after the forty minutes that it took me to finish the 5K. It felt like  the mountains wanted to make sure that I did not get too cocky. 

We had planned to leave right after our lunch, but the heavens opened up  and quickly transformed into hail. We scurried to our cabs when the  intensity reduced after a hurried round of goodbyes. The rain never  ceased the entire 4-hour ride back to Siliguri. Amalesh and I parted  from the rest of the group - who were staying the night at Siliguri, and headed to the NJP railway station. We talked about our future travel  plans over dinner. He wanted to go to Gaumukh-Tapovan; the source of the mighty Ganga by the end of the year. I was not so sure - on one hand, I wanted to travel truly solo and on the other, trekking seemed very  inviting; especially after completing one a day before. I had been  eyeing the North East - Meghalaya in particular as the destination of my first solo trip and got a few pointers from him. He also planted the  idea of clubbing Meghalaya and Dzukou Valley - a two or three-day trek  in Manipur as one trip. The more I think about it, the more I like it. 

Amalesh left at 10 pm to board his train back home while I got some sleep in  one of the dorms in the railway station. At 4 am, I found my way to the  platform the Agartala Humsafar - my train back to college, was to arrive on when I found ten of my batchmates waiting for the same train. They  had gone on a five-day-long trip to Gangtok and were in the same coach  as me on the train. Just as the train was arriving, I realized that I  had left my phone's charger back in the dorm room. Sprinting across an  over bridge and few flights of stairs and back after a few days of  trekking was as much fun as it sounds like. I boarded the train and was  too sleepy to bid adieu to what was a week that had me digging deep into my mental reserves while awarding me with great satisfaction.
