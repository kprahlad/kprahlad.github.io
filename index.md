Hello! I'm K. Prahlad Narasimhan. I'm from Chennai, Tamil Nadu and am  doing my Integrated M.Sc. in the School of Mathematical Sciences at [NISER, Bhubaneswar](https://www.niser.ac.in){:target="_blank"}. I enjoy doing problems in theoretical computer science. To keep myself  sane, I run long-ish distances, trek longer distances, and take pictures of things. Head over to the [Academics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/academics.md %}) section to take a look at mathematics thinly veiled as computer science and to the [Personal]({{ site.baseurl }}/tag/personal) section for anything but. My twitter handle is [@pranarkas](https://twitter.com/pranarkas){:target="_blank"} and my email address is [kprahlad.narasimhan@niser.ac.in](mailto: kprahlad.narasimhan@niser.ac.in){:target="_blank"}.

**Topics I am currently working on:** Computational Geometry, Graph Theory, Parameterized Complexity.
